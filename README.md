# Predicting Housing Prices
![alt text](http://blog.time2move.ca/files/2014/09/Rising-house-prices.jpg)
## What is this repository?
As an upcoming ML engineer, I challenged myself to put my machine learning skills to the test. I challenged myself by tackling the [Housing Prices Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). The goal of this challenge is to predict the prices of houses in Ames, Iowa based on a given set of features. To be exact, there are 79 features in total. This project allows the engineer (in this case myself) to practice critical Data Science & Machine Learning techniques.    
    
This repository is organized via 4 folders: Submissions, Data, Code, and Models. In the Submissions folder, you will see the various submissions that I have made. In the Data folder, you will find the necessary datasets as well as any other necessary information. In the Code folder, you will see my various Jupyter Notebooks & Python Scripts for the project. Finally, in the models folder, you will see the various models that I have saved.  
    
The model is evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error, as this is the metric we are trying to minimize. My best model has a RMSE of N/A. 
  
Note: you may use my solution as a reference; however, I would strongly advise you to tackle this challenge on your own. The only way you will get better at machine learning is to practice it on your own. I do not condone nor am I responsible for any cheating that may occur as a result of this repository.
