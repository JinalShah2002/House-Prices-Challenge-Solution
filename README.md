# The Housing Prices Challenge!
The Jupyter Notebook goes through the Kaggle Housing Prices dataset & engineers an effective, working solution.

You either download the data from the 'Data' folder or retrieve it from the [competition website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The score for the model is determined by the [Root Mean Square Error(RSME)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation). In other words, the lower your RSME, the higher your ranking for the challenge. Current RSME is __N/A__. 

Finally, this repository should not be used for cheating purposes. The only way to get better at Machine Learning is to keep practicing!

Enjoy! Jinal Shah
